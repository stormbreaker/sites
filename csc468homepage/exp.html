      <h4>General</h4>
      <p>
          Benjamin Kaiser has worked at two distinct points in time for Safeway Inc. The first was for a little over a year, beginning in June of 2013, at the end of which,
          he resigned his position to attend school in Rapid City, SD.  The second was during the summer between his sophomore and junior year of college.
          <br>
          <br>
          During his first time working at the store, he began as a Courtesy Clerk.  Duties assigned to courtesy clerks included bagging customers' groceries,
          bringing in grocery carts from the parking lot, performing safety inspections of the sales floor, cleaning bathrooms, and taking out trash from all over
          the store.  Other miscellaneous tasks were performed as assigned by the manager and requested by other higher-ranking employees.
          <br>
          <br>
          After four months of making favorable impressions on all of his managers and co-workers, the store manager promoted Ben to All-Purpose Food Clerk (APFC).
          Duties carried out by an APFC include stocking grocery shelves and checking.  For about five months, Ben worked as an evening stocker and checker.  He was
          also in charge of training new courtesy clerks.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the end of those five months, however, Ben was transferred into the dairy department to substitute while the main dairy employee was out on sick-leave.
          During this time, he was in charge of inventory management as well as stocking.  He ordered dairy product as required and also maintained the dates
          on all of the dairy products.  About one month in, the store hired a new employee to assist in the dairy and to take over when Ben
          went to school.  One exceptional experience that Ben had was to be placed as acting store manager for a few hours.  This occurred when the head manager
          of the store was not feeling good but her relief manager was not able to come in for several hours.  The store manager left instructions for Ben on
          running the store until the assistant manager could get there.  As a result of this and his previous experience with training the dairy employee and courtesy clerks, Ben has a fair amount of managemental
          and leadership experience.
          <br>
          <br>
          Ben returned to Safeway in the summer of 2015 as a night stocker and for the last two weeks of summer he reassumed his position as dairy clerk.
          As night stocker, Ben was expected to stock grocery shelves at night while the store was closed as well as organize the backroom.  The one exceptional
          experience is that Ben was placed in charge of the store for one night.  During this night, he had to make sure all the other stockers did their work
          as well as open the store in the morning by making sure all the opening checkers showed up on time.  This added to his experience of leadership and management.

      <h4>Computer and Technology</h4>
      <p>
          Ben has a broad experience in the computer and technology field.  Beginning with programming at the age of 16, he has the most experience in the C++
          programming language which he used almost exclusively until the fall semester of 2015 when he began coding in Java, Python, and Lisp as well as C++.  He
          also became more familiar with the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is currently attempting to learn C#.
          <br>
          Ben has also been familiar with HTML since he was 15 and is now learning to incorporate CSS, PHP, and JavaScript into his websites (including this one).
          <br>
          Ben's experience with operating systems include using Windows XP growing up, using and developing on Windows 7, using and developing on Windows 10
          and using and developing on both the Fedora and the Mint distributions of Linux.  He has also accquired a taste for the Mac OS as well because of it's
          similarity to the Linux OS and for it's use in iOS development.
          <br>
          <br>
          Outside of programming Ben has experience with various disciplines including computer art and stop-motion animation.
          During his senior year of high school, Ben completed a course in the 3D graphics software called <a href="https://www.blender.org">Blender</a>
          from <a href="http://ocw.tufts.edu/Course/71/Coursehome"> Tuft's University</a>.  He has also made multiple stop-motion animations with LEGO bricks
          and a webcam.  In addition to this, Ben has also created a few videos using Minecraft which can be seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLETtq7LE4NZAwukhdnlMrgsbDEWQsiAzu">
              YouTube</a>.
