      <h3>Genealogy "Database" with Lisp</h3>
      <p>
        <h5>Status</h5> Completed
        <h5>Class:</h5> CSC 461 - Programming Languages
        <h5>Goal:</h5> Introduction to Lisp/Functional Programming
        <h5>Description</h5>
          This program was written in Lisp by Benjamin Kaiser as an individual
          project for the Fall 2015 Programming Languages class taught by Dr. John
          Weiss.  The code is a terminal script which when given a file containing
          structures of people, reads these structures into a global list.
          The script also defines functions which are entered in the read-eval-print-loop
          within the Lisp interpreter.  These functions include finding the parents,
          children, ancestors, and descendants of a certain individual.
        <h5>Reflections</h5>
          This was my first experience with a functional programming language.
          As with my first experience with OOP (See "Java 'Paint'"), the functional
          paradigm was quite overwhelming and hard to wrap my head around.  However,
          I kept my interest because I learned that functional programming is key
          in the AI field in which I have a lot of interest.

      <h3>Java "Paint"</h3>
      <p>
        <h5>Status</h5> Completed
        <h5>Class:</h5> CSC 461 - Programming Languages
        <h5>Goal:</h5> Introduction to Java/Object-Oriented Programming
        <h5>Description</h5>
          The program was written in Java by Benjamin Kaiser and Taylor Doell as
          a group project for the Fall 2015 Programming Languages class taught by
          Dr. John Weiss.  The program is a GUI program which allows users to
          draw rectangles, ellipses, and lines with differing preset colors.  The
          rectangles, ellipses, and lines were all implemented in a shape hiearchy
          which was called when a different shape was selected.
        <h5>Reflections</h5>
          This was my first experience with a purely object-oriented programming
          language.  At first, I was overwhelmed by the new paradigm but soon
          realized how useful it really is.  It does take a little bit to wrap
          one's head around the concept and this still troubles me a little even
          after writing this program.

      <h3>Minimum Distance Classifier</h3>
      <p>
        <h5>Status:</h5> Completed
        <h5>Class:</h5> CSC 461- Programming Languages
        <h5>Goal:</h5> Introduction to Python
        <h5>Description:</h5>
         The program was written in Python by Benjamin Kaiser and Christian Sieh
         as a group project for the Fall 2015 Programming Languages class taught
         by Dr. John Weiss.  The program was used to process comma-separated value
         (CSV) files that it was given as a command-line argument and to try and
         classify the different data samples that were in these files as a means
         of demonstrating machine learning.  Because of the lack of data and the
         fact that this was not intended to focus on machine learning but rather
         to focus on Python, this program used the same training and sample data.
         Each CSV file was read in and trained on and then when we wished to classify
         a sample item, one was intentionally left out, the program trained on the
         other data and then attempted to classify the item which was left out.
         <h5>Reflections</h5>
          This was my first real experience in coding in a language other than C++.
          As such it was rather confusing but also very intriguing.  I learned a
          lot from this project about different languages and programming paradigms.
          It helped me broaden my view of how to tackle problems besides simply
          compressing all problems into C++.
